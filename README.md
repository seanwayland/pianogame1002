PIANO GAME :

A 2 player or one player ear training guessing game. Players choose notes from the musical chromatic scale and a melody length. The computer generates a random melody. The players can listen to the melody by pressing a button multiple times to play the melody sequence.

In the one player version there is a "bank" with 10000 in it. Increasing the number of notes chosen and the length increases the "bet amount" . A keyboard is used to "guess" the melody. Player gets 3 guesses. A correct guess removes money from the bank account and adds it to the players bank. If the bank runs out of money the player wins.

In the 2 player version each player has 10,000 to start and takes turn having 3 guesses at a melody. Each player chooses the notes and melody length for his/her/nonbinary turn. The goal is to bankrupt the other player in the 2 player version. In the 2 player version choosing all 12 chromatic notes for the melody will make each melody note worth a lot more.

A player can choose a one player or 2 player game. If a player chooses a 2 player game they can see a list of playing games and ask to join ones with only one player in them. A 2 player game can be restarted or deleted.
